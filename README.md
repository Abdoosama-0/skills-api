## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
**Skills API** is a simple **Node.js + Express.js** project for managing skills data stored in a JSON file.  
It demonstrates how to:
- Build RESTful API endpoints.  
- Fetch all skills with **filtering, sorting, and category-based queries**.  
- Retrieve a single skill by its **ID**.  
- Organize and serve JSON-based data using Express routes.  

This project was created as part of a learning exercise on **Express.js**, **API development**, and **JSON file handling** in Node.js.
